# Article review: The Road to Clarity

Published in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/magazine/12fonts-t.html?mcubz=3) in 2007, *The Road to Clarity* describes the history of font selection in road signage, focusing on the motivations and labors behind the newest font, [Clearview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_(typeface)), which replaced [Highway Gothic Series E (Modified)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Gothic). While the fonts have an overall similarity, Clearview aimed to be more readable. The most significant change is the way Clearview opens up the font, with larger [counters](https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary/counter/) that are more readable when blurred due to visual effects of driving at night or in adverse weather.

Along the way we learn about the fonts used in other countries. European typefaces were considered: the UK's [Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_(typeface)), [Univers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers) (Paris Metro and early Apple keyboards), [DIN 1451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451) for roads and trains in Germany. Countries have their own style. "Type on the roadway is very much like the corporate identify of a country." However, these fonts had the same readability issues.

The last notable improvement to Clearview was increasing the x-height. This allowed larger lowercase letters for a given font size. This, in turn, increased the readability of the font at distances. This idea came from Montalbano's experience designing [NPS Rawlinson Roadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPS_Rawlinson_Roadway) to replace [Clarendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarendon_(typeface)), the typeface used by the US National Park Service.

Most roadway fonts are sans-serif. Sans-serif fonts came into wider use in the 1920s with [Futura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)), and in the 1950s with [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica). The article says these are fonts of choice for designs that require a "clean, vaguely futuristc aesthetic."
