# Inspiration: Newton's Principia Mathematica

Typeface: Jenson, which ties to era

Ideas: Written in latter 1600s, the PM introduced us to the 3 laws, as well as law of gravity (among numerous other groundbreaking ideas). Jenson and its derivatives were used for 17th centery books that were primarily text. But the PM was illustrated. Imagine if it were typeset with Illustrator, using type for illustrations. Play with anachronistic theme, kind of like alternative history/reality.

## Pages
* Title Page "Newton's Principia Mathematics, presented in Nicolas Jenson's Eponymous Typeface." Looking at ideas from [original](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Prinicipia-title.png/220px-Prinicipia-title.png), [Blink](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669), or [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7FPG8A1TDZYK27S5D6YE)
* First law (object in motions stays in motion, unless acted upon by external force) (2 pages). Images throughout use type as figure, especially showing off ligatures if possible. Also use text as area fill
  * skater on River Thames
  * type-filled rocket, gliding through space
* Second law (F = ma)(2 pages)
  * block of text (e.g. shaped like draft horse) pulling another block (a cart)
  * repeat same images, but reduce cart by half, show effect on facing page
* Third law (For each force, there is an equal an opposite force) (2 pages)
* Conservation of Momentum (1 page)
* Gravity illustrated with cannonballs launched from a tall mountain  (1 page)
* Differentiation (1 page)
  * line of text (all capitals, for fixed line height) tangent to circle
* Integration (1 page)
  * filled area under arc of ellipse
* Binomial Theorem (1 page)
  * Pascal's triangle for numbers
* A couple pages of type catalog
