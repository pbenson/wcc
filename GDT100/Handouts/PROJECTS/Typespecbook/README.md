# Inspiration: Newton's Principia Mathematica

Typeface: Jenson, which ties to era

Ideas: Written in latter 1600s, the PM introduced us to the 3 laws, as well as law of gravity (among numerous other groundbreaking ideas). Jenson was likely used for books that were primarily text. But the PM was illustrated. Imagine if it were typeset with Illustrator, using type for illustrations.
