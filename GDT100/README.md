## [GDT 100: Typography](http://www.wccnet.edu/academics/classes/information/view/class/GDT%20100/)

Here's the [schedule](Handouts/_GDT100-01_Schedule.pdf).

## [Workshop: Type Anatomy Research](Type_Anatomy_Research.pdf)

Our first workshop assignment. We explored terms used to describe typography, and we each created a PDF that explained one of the terms. I was assigned [*bowl*](pbenson_bowl.pdf).

## [Workshop: 27th Letter](https://rawgit.com/pbenson/wcc/master/GDT100/Handouts/WORKSHOPS/03_27thletter.pdf)

We selected a typeface, and created a new 27th letter with Illustrator. I selected Futura, a very geometric font. I was interested in creating a symmetric letter, which in Futura lowercase includes i, l, o, t, u, v, w, and x. I also wanted the uppercase to be symmetric, but not simply a larger version, since most letters differ significantly between uppercase and lowercase. Here's the [result](https://rawgit.com/pbenson/wcc/master/GDT100/Handouts/WORKSHOPS/27th_benson.pdf).
