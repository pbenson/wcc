***************** roman_calculator   *****************
roman_calculator  output as specified in the JH4 homework.
Notes:
- I reused the input code from a past assignment since its mostly the same.
- I'm using a slightly different output for the answer. I'm showing the operator, operands and the answer. If this will affect my grade, let me know, and I will make it EXACTLY the same as the txt file from now on.

Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: +
Enter operand 1
M
Enter operand 2
mCxV
M + MCXV = MMCXV

=======================
Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: -

XX
Enter operand 2
v
XX - V = XV

=======================
Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: *
Enter operand 1
x
Enter operand 2
lx
X * LX = DC

=======================
Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: /
Enter operand 1
dc

Enter operand 1
m
Enter operand 2
cxi
M - CXI = DCCCLXXXVIIII

=======================
Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: ^
Your operator is bad ... try again:
Enter an Operator: + - * / q for quit: +
Enter operand 1
